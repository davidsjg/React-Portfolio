# React-Portfolio

Introduction: The goal of this website is to update my project portfolio website using React. Three components were required: header, project, and footer. Routing internally

Technologies: React, HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Node, Inquirer, Jest

Launch: The application launches when 'npm start' is entered into the terminal.

Scope of Functionalities: Once the application is launched in the terminal, the user is greeted with a homepage. This homepage links to three separate pages using a Router. Individual components are linked to the router pages specified. Inside of the pages, components are inserted to build the website. The card component that renders the main portfolio page maps over the projects array of objects. The projects are loaded into this array of objects, which is stored in the projects.json file. The card component utilizes props that are passed down from the App.js file. Those props are the key/value pairs inserted into the projects.json file. Through this, we are able to individually load each project at the parent index level from its children.

Potential Future Plans: Add new projects. Update and improve as more React knowledge is ascertained.
